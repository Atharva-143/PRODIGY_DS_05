### Task-05: Traffic Accident Data Analysis

Internship: Data Science Internship – Prodigy InfoTech

---

### Objective
To analyze traffic accident data in order to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day, and to visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

---

### Dataset
Source: US Accidents Dataset (Kaggle)

Description:
The dataset contains detailed records of traffic accidents across the United States, including time, location, weather conditions, visibility, and accident severity. Due to the large size of the dataset, a sampled subset of the data was used for analysis.

---

### Data Preparation
- Loaded a sampled subset of the dataset to ensure efficient processing.
- Selected relevant features related to time, location, weather, visibility, and severity.
- Converted time-related columns to datetime format.
- Extracted hour and month for temporal analysis.
- Handled missing values where required for analysis.

---

### Analysis and Visualizations
The following analyses were performed:

- Accidents by hour of the day to identify peak accident times.
- Accidents by month to observe seasonal trends.
- Top weather conditions during accidents to understand environmental factors.
- Relationship between accident severity and visibility using box plots.

---

### Results
- Accident frequency shows clear peaks during commuting hours.
- Seasonal trends indicate variations in accident counts across different months.
- A significant number of accidents occur during clear weather conditions.
- Lower visibility is associated with higher accident severity.

---

### Conclusion
This analysis highlights how time, weather conditions, and visibility contribute to traffic accidents. Visualizing these patterns helps in understanding accident-prone situations and can support better road safety planning and decision-making.
